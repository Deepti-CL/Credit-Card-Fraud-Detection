 Project Highlights:  

- Objective: Enhance fraud detection systems (FDS) by comparing and optimizing multiple classification algorithms for improved performance.  
- Algorithms Used: Implemented and evaluated Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost.  
- Key Findings: 
  - XGBoost consistently outperformed other algorithms in all tested scenarios.  
  - Frequent model updates (e.g., weekly or biweekly) showed clear performance gains compared to static updates (annual/biannual).  
  - Sampling techniques to rebalance classes significantly improved classifier performance in fraud detection.  
- Industry Relevance: Demonstrated the impact of dynamic, scalable, and data-driven approaches on improving fraud detection systems currently relying on static models.
